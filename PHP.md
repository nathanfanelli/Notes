PHP  Notes:

PHP (PHP Hypertext Preprocessor)

Current version (2019) is PHP 7. 

PHP code can be embedded directly in HTML. 

PHP is a server-side language, meaning the code is processed on the server. The server returns plain HTML. 

Basic code example: 

<?php 
	echo ‘Hello World’;
?>

The command line interface (CLI) processes the PHP code and returns only the output. 

PHP does NOT care about extra whitespace. 

3 types of comments in PHP: 

1. Single Line ( // )
2. Multi-line ( /*…*/ )
3. DocBlock ( /* *** */ )

Variables in PHP are always prefaced with a ‘$’.

There are four data types supported in PHP: 

1. Boolean
2. Integer
3. Float
4. String

  ‘var_dump’ dumps information about a variable (data type and value)
